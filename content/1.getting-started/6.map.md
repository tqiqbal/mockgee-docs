# Map

Mockgee supports, out of the box, mapping request field's value in the Mock/stub response, and hence provides dynamism to mock responses.

## Mapping JSON field

Use JSON path to map request field into response JSON.
::alert
JSONPath is a query language for JSON, similar to XPath for XML. It allows you to select and extract data from a JSON document. You use a JSONPath expression to traverse the path to an element in the JSON structure.
::

Example of mapping `ID` field of request JSON to `id` field of response data using JSONPath.
::code-group
```js [Request]
{
    "request": {
    "ID": "12345",
    "type": "account"
    }
}
```

```js [Response]
{
    "response": {
    "firstName": "John",
    "lastName": "Doe",
    "account": {
        "id": "0000",
        "type": "billing"
    }
   }
}
```

```text [JSON Path]
Request Path - request.ID
Response Path - response.account.id
```
::



## Mapping SOAP/XML field

Use XPath to map request field to response XML/SOAP.
::alert
XPath is an expression language designed to support the query or transformation of XML documents.
::

Example of mapping `userId` field of request XML to `empId` field of response data using XPath.
::code-group
```xml [Request]
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <root>
        <userId>123</userId>
        <type>User</type>
    </root>
```

```xml [Response]
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <root>
        <empId>123</empId>
        <city>San Jose</city>
        <firstName>John</firstName>
        <lastName>Doe</lastName>
        <state>CA</state>
    </root>
```

```text [X Path]
Request Path - root.userId
Response Path - root.empId
```
::


::alert{type=danger}
Please note that a XML/SOAP data with `namespace` must be included in XPath.
::

Example of mapping `QuotationsName` field of request SOAP to `QuotationsName` field of response data using XPath.
::code-group
```xml [Request]
<?xml version = "1.0"?>
<SOAP-ENV:Envelope
   xmlns:SOAP-ENV = "http://www.w3.org/2001/12/soap-envelope"
   SOAP-ENV:encodingStyle = "http://www.w3.org/2001/12/soap-encoding">
   <SOAP-ENV:Body xmlns:m = "http://www.xyz.org/quotations">
      <m:GetQuotation>
         <m:QuotationsName>MiscroSoft</m:QuotationsName>
      </m:GetQuotation>
   </SOAP-ENV:Body>
</SOAP-ENV:Envelope>
```

```xml [Response]
<?xml version = "1.0"?>
<SOAP-ENV:Envelope
   xmlns:SOAP-ENV = "http://www.w3.org/2001/12/soap-envelope"
   SOAP-ENV:encodingStyle = "http://www.w3.org/2001/12/soap-encoding">
   <SOAP-ENV:Body xmlns:m = "http://www.xyz.org/quotation">
      <m:GetQuotationResponse>
         <m:Quotation>Here is the quotation</m:Quotation>
      </m:GetQuotationResponse>
   </SOAP-ENV:Body>
</SOAP-ENV:Envelope>
```

```text [X Path]
Request Path - SOAP-ENV:Envelope.SOAP-ENV:Body.m:GetQuotation.m:QuotationsName
Response Path - SOAP-ENV:Envelope.SOAP-ENV:Body.m:GetQuotationResponse.m:QuotationsName
```
