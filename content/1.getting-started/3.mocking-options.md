# Mocking Options

Mockgee offers a variety of options for creating API mocks.


## Data Type

:badge[JSON]

:badge[SOAP]{type="warning"}

::badge{type="danger"}
XML
::


## Dynamic Responses

Mockgee supports creating multiple mock responses for a single endpoint and at runtime matches with the request and returns the response accordingly.
::alert
Mockgee also lets you create a [Default Response](/introduction/default-response) to return or [Proxying Request](/introduction/proxy) to actual system if request does not match with any configured mock.
::



## HTTP Method
Create your API mock using any of the below methods:

::list{type="success"}
- GET
- POST
- PUT
- PATCH
- DELETE
- HEAD
::

## Status Code

Mockgee supports setting standard status codes defined in RFC 2616.

::alert{type="info"}
Status codes defined in RFC 2616 <https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html>
::



## Response Header
Mockgee automatically sets the `Content-Type` for the mock response based on the response payload.
<br>
For JSON payload `Content-Type` sets to `application/json`, XML `Content-Type` sets to `application/xml`
and for SOAP payload `Content-Type` sets to `text/xml`

::alert{type="info"}
Mockgee also supports setting custom response headers that can be returned in the mock response.
::


## Request Matching


### Request Payload
Mockgee lets you define multiple request-response combinations and matches at runtime with incoming request and return a response for the matched request. This makes an API mock endpoint dynamic.

### Query Param

Mockgee supports setting `Query string` in the URL of API endpoints and making a mock dynamic with multiple `Query string` value sets with a different response.
<br>
<br>
::alert
Mockgee supports both static and dynamic `Query string` matching options.
::

Static Query String example - https://example.com/api/v1/user?type=internal (or `?type=external`)
<br>
This sets different responses for different query string params.

::code-group
```js [internal]
curl -X GET https://example.com/api/v1/user?type=interal

{
    "name": "ABC",
    "ID": 100,
    "type": "internal"
}
```

```js [external]
curl -X GET https://example.com/api/v1/user?type=external

{
    "name": "XYZ",
    "ID": 200,
    "type": "external"
}
```
::


Dynamic Duery String example - https://example.com/api/v1/user?* (This matches any `Query string` in the URL and returns the same response)
<br>
<br>
This is useful when you don't to create multiple responses for each `Query string`

```js [Dynamic Query string]
curl -X GET https://example.com/api/v1/user?type=interal

{
    "name": "ABC",
    "ID": 100,
    "type": "internal"
}
```


### Path Param

Mockgee supports setting the `Path param` in the URL of API mock endpoints and accepting any value for the path param. 

::alert{type="info"}
Mockgee supports setting both `*` and `{pathName}` in the URL of the endpoint.
::

Example of using path param
Option 1: https://mockgee.com/api/v1/user/* or https://mockgee.com/api/v1/user/*/id
<br>
<br>
Option 2: https://mockgee.com/api/v1/user/{type} or https://mockgee.com/api/v1/user/{type}/id


## Dyanimc Fields

Mockgee, out-of-box, supports making the mock response field's value dynamic with the below data types, and  returns new value.

::
 

## Map
Mockgee, out-of-the-box, allows receiving the request field's value in the mock response. For example, a customer ID number should return dynamically in the mock response.

## CORS Support
::alert
By default mockgee support for CORS allow the request comes from another domain.
