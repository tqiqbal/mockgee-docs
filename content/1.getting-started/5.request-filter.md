# Request Filter


## Request filter

Mockgee lets you apply a filter condition on request data, and let you choose either `pick` (match only specific fields) or `omit` (ignoring a specific field)

### Pick

The Mockgee `pick` request matching condition lets you choose specific fields from the request data and match only those fields and get a response.

### Omit

The Mockgee `omit` request matching condition lets you remove specific fields from the request data and match the remaining fields and get a response.
