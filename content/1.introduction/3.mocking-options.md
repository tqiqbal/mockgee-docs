XML
::


## Dynamic Responses

::alert
Mockgee supports creating multiple mock responses for a single endpoint and at runtime matches with the request and returns the response accordingly.
<br>
<br>
Mockgee also lets you create a [Default Response](/introduction/default-response) to return or [Proxying Request](/introduction/proxy) to actual system if request does not match with any configured mock.
::



## HTTP Method
Create your API mock using any of the below methods:

::list{type="success"}
- GET
- POST
- PUT
- PATCH
- DELETE
- HEAD
::

## Status Code

::alert{type="info"}
HTTP response status codes indicate whether a specific HTTP request has been successfully completed
<br/>
Mockgee supports almost all status codes defined in RFC 2616 <https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html>
::



## Response Header
::alert{type="success"}
Mockgee automatically sets the `Content-Type` for the mock response based on the response payload.
<br>
<br>
Mockgee also supports setting custom response headers that can be returned in the mock response.
::


## Request Matching

::alert{type="danger"}
Mockgee provides the most advanced [request-matching options](/introduction/matching-request) for making your API mocks dynamically.
::

## Query Param
::alert{type="success"}
Mockgee supports setting `Query string` in the URL of API endpoints and making a mock dynamic with multiple `Query string` value sets with a different response.
<br>
<br>
Mockgee supports both static and dynamic `Query string` matching options.
<br>
<br>
Example of using static query string - https://mockgee.com/api/v1/user?type=internal (Sets `type` value to external, or any other value ... and sets different response accordingly)
<br>
<br>
Example of using dynamic query string - https://mockgee.com/api/v1/user?* (This matches any `query string` in the URL and returns the configured response)
::


## Path Param
::alert{type="info"}
Mockgee supports setting the `Path param` in the URL of API endpoints and accepting any value for the path param. 
<br>
<br>
Mockgee supports setting both `*` and `{pathName}` in the URL of the endpoint.
<br>
<br>
`Example of using path param`
<br>
<br>
Option 1: https://mockgee.com/api/v1/user/* or https://mockgee.com/api/v1/user/*/id
<br>
Option 2: https://mockgee.com/api/v1/user/{type} or https://mockgee.com/api/v1/user/{type}/id
