# Getting Started

From your Markdown files to a deployed website in few minutes.

## Create a new project

1. Start a Mockgee Docker container:

```bash [docker]
docker run -it -p 8080:8080 -p 8085:8085 --name mockgee-server mockgee/mockgee:latest
```

2. Browse and login to UI:

::alert{type="success"}
âœ¨ Well done! A browser window should automatically open for <http://localhost:8080>
::

3. Create an API mock by importing Open API Specfication 3.x, a Postman's Collection or through UI:

::alert{type="info"}
The starter uses the [Docs Theme](/guide/features).
