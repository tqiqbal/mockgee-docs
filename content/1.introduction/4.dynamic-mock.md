# Dynamic Mock

Dynamic mocking is one of the unique feature of the mockgee wherein API mocks can return dynamic responses and fields.

## Dynamic responses

Mockgee lets you create multiple request-response combinations and returns a response based on the request payload

::alert{type="info"}
Check out the [Guide section](/guide/theming/usage) about creating dynamic mock response.

## Dynamic fields

Mockgee, out-of-box, supports making the mock response field's value dynamic with the below data types, and  returns new value.

::alert
Sets the field value with placeholder `$$` with below data types.
<br>
<br>
For example - 
{ "ID": 100, "name": "John", "isEmployee": "$$.BOOLEAN" }

<br>
would return either - { "ID": 100, "name": "John", "isEmployee": true }
or { "ID": 100, "name": "John", "isEmployee": false }
::

::callout{type=warning}
#summary
UUID

#content
This sets dynamic UUID value to any configured field in the mock respons.
::

::callout{type=warning}
#summary
INT

#content
This expression is to set an integer value to a field like -  `$$.INT.{SIZE}`
<br>
For example - `$$.INT.8` would return  { 48983920, 93877372, 837923837...} for every mock response.
::

::callout{type=warning}
#summary
INTS

#content
This expression is to set stringified integer value to a field like -  `$$.INTS.{SIZE}`
<br>
For example - `$$.INTS.8` would return  { "48983920", "93877372", "837923837" ...} for every mock response.
::

::alert{type=info}
Data type INT & INTS support setting additional (optional) tokens to add `prefix` or `suffix` to a dynamic integer value.
<br>
For example - `$$.INT|INTS.8.PREFIX.[PO-]` would return  { "PO-48983920", "PO-93877372", "PO-837923837"...} for every mock response.
::

::callout{type=warning}
#summary
TEXT

#content
This sets the dynamically random text to any configured field in the mock response.
::

::callout{type=warning}
#summary
TIMESTAMP

#content
This sets a dynamically current timestamp to any configured field in the mock response.
::

::callout{type=warning}
#summary
BOOLEAN
#content
This sets a field to return either `true` or `false` by using placeholder `$$.BOOLEAN`
::

::callout{type=warning}
#summary
ENUM
#content
The mockgee `ENUM` placeholder feature lets you set multiple values and dynamically return a value from it in the mock response.

ENUM example - `$$.ENUM.[London, New York]`. The mock response returns either of these values.
