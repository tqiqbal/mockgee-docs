## Bulk mock

Mockgee supports creating API mocks of all operations inside your Open API Specification file. (The OpenAPI Specification (OAS) defines a standard, programming language-agnostic way of describing HTTP APIs.)



## REST API

The REST API allows accessing the content-types through API endpoints. Strapi automatically creates API endpoints when a content-type is created. API parameters can be used when querying API endpoints to refine the results.
